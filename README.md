# PyTorch Highway Networks
[Highway networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387) implemented in [PyTorch](pytorch.org).

Just the [MNIST example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist) from [PyTorch](pytorch.org) hacked to work with Highway layers.

## TODO
- ~~make the Highway `nn.Module` reuseable and configurable~~
- conv highway networks
- recurrent highway networks
