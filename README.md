# PyTorch_Highway_Networks
Highway networks implemented in PyTorch.

Just the MNIST example from PyTorch hacked to work with Highway layers.

I'm still looking at how the bias effects the network as you increase the number of layers and I am also taking a took on making the Highway `nn.Module` more reuseable.
