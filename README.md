# PyTorch Highway Networks
[Highway networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387) implemented in [PyTorch](pytorch.org).

![Highway Equation](/highway.png)

Just the MNIST example from PyTorch hacked to work with Highway layers.

## TODO
- ~~make the Highway `nn.Module` reuseable and configurable~~
- conv highway networks
- recurrent highway networks
